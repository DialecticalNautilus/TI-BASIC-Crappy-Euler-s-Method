# TI-BASIC-Crappy-Euler-s-Method
A crappy little calculator Euler's Method program I made, when AP Calc BC got too repetitive and busywork-y.

It's nothing special, really.

THE SETUP
I was up late doing HW, when I stumbled across an Euler's Method problem that had 5 'steps', which was easy-peasy, but slightly
time-consuming, especially considering I had Youtube to watch, and it was quite late. I work my magic and get through it, when I
then realize, to my dismay, the next question was the EXACT same problem, but with 10 'steps', effectively doubling the amount of
time it would take to finish the problem. Oh hell no.

THE SOLUTION
It's hilariously simple, because you know, it's an apprentice's shoddy and quick program for a highly straightforward math concept.

You have the standard [INPUT]s which, ya know, ask for inputs, you got yourself some classic variable vagueness b/c TI Basic sucks
and it's impossible to tell what is going on without scouring the code (because the variables are all SINGLE LETTERS, the bane of
newbie programmers' existences), and you gotch yoself a simple ickle algorithm to calculate the X, Y, and DY variables. It all
finishes off with the best output solution I could think of, which is to output each line, or step, one-by-one with a pause in between,
because otherwise the screen usually can't fit every step, and fixing up output to be legible is terrible in TI Basic because, again,
it is a 'fun' language to work with.
